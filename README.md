Alice and Bob each created one problem. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is defined to be the triplet A=(a0,a1,a2) , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet B=(b0,b1,b2) .

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a0 with b0, a1  with b1, and a2 with b2.

If ai>bi, then Alice is awarded  point.
If ai<bi, then Bob is awarded  point.
If ai=bi, then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.
